## Overview

The goal of `rgts` is to provide convenient methods for accessing and downloading the GridTimeSeries (GTS) data for Norway (api.nve.no/doc/gridtimeseries-data-gts/) from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE). This data repository contains 1x1 km grid time series data for Norway and includes several weather and environmental parameters, such as temperature, precipitation, wind direction and strength and snow depth. Data is available at 1h, 3h and daily intervals depending on the variable of interest. Many of the daily variables go back from present to 1957.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `rgts` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thomas-kvalnes/rgts")
```

## Features

```{r load rgts}
library(rgts)
```

The variables available in the GridTimeSeries (GTS) data can be listed using the `gts_parameters`-function. Here we show the first five:

```{r parameters}
head(gts_parameters(), 5)
```

The `Name` column contain the parameter names which is used to specify which data layer to download. Downloading GTS data is made simple by a set of functions with prefix `gts_dl_...`. We can download data for points of interest with `gts_dl_points`, and for areas of interest with `gts_dl_polygon` or `gts_dl_polygon_aggr`. The first returns values for each grid cell within the polygon, while the latter returns aggregated values across the grid cells within the polygon. Faster downloads for areas or points can be done with the `gts_dl_cellindex` and `gts_dl_cellindex_aggr`-functions, if the cellindex for each grid cell of interest is known or identified using the `gts_cellindex`-function. See the 'Get started' tab for more details on using all of these functions. As a brief first demonstration, data for grid cells which contain some points of interest can be downloaded using:

```{r points}
## Create a data frame with coordinates
coords <- data.frame(x = c(58200, 74225), y = c(6708225, 6715025))
## Download data
gts_dl_coords(coords = coords, parameter = "tm", start_date = "2023-12-01", end_date = "2023-12-02")

```

Here the coordinates we supplied are returned, as well as the corresponding cellindex, average altitude in the grid cell, date, time, time resolution, units of measurement and the values of `tm`, the parameter of interest, in these grid cells.

## More information about data
Questions about the data should be directed to [NVE](https://www.nve.no/om-nve/kontakt/). The R-package maintainer is only responsible for developing the `rgts`-package which provide access to the data.
